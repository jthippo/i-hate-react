export default function What() {

    <main>
      <h2>What am I going to do about it?</h2>
      <p>Stomp around make a face like this: &gt;:-|</p>
      <p>
        I had to look up how to make that face inside a &lt;p&gt; tag without
        triggering code elements and now I've learnt about "HTML entities" so
        that's pretty good.

        Nah, I'll persist with React and eventually it'll make sense. But for
        now... oh boy you better believe I am MAD.
      </p>
      <p className="littleBoi">I'm not actually that mad.</p>
    </main>
