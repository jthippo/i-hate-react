export default function How() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>How mad does React make me?</h2>
      <p>Real mad.</p>
      <p>
        So mad, in fact, that I'm going to do as little CSS as possible outside
        of making this square orange:
      </p>
      <div className="orangeBoi"></div>
    </main>
  );
}
